        ðŸ‘‹Hi, my name is Terry Partridge. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer
        based in Mission Viejo, California. My primary development experience
        for frontend and backend has been in React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL,
        Express, and Node. I love the creative process associated with
        developing software and the constant advances in software development
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p style={{ paddingBottom: "1rem", fontSize: "1.5rem" }}>
        When I am not at my computer, I am usually outside running or hiking,
        interacting with my wife and children, or maybe building some new home
        project.
      </p>
    </Box>
